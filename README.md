This is an under-construction set of files to support teaching some basic coding and data analysis to law students.  

Anyone else who wants to use it for similar purposes, please feel free to do so.  It's available under the Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA license.  Copyright 2015, Paul Gowder, http://paul-gowder.com.  I would appreciate if you let me know if this is useful to you.

That copyright claim only applies to the code and text in the ipython notebook.  The associated data file is just a bunch of Supreme Court opinions.  It's large (some 67mb), and is derived from data made available by the Free Law Project at http://www.courtlistener.com/, so I claim no rights whatsoever to that file; neither do the folks at the Free Law Project, who have committed their database to the public domain (and anyway, it's a standard format mostly comprised of government documents; copyright claims in it would be pretty dubious in general).
