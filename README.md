This is an under-construction set of files to support teaching some basic coding and data analysis to law students.  

Right now, hack-law.ipynb is an ipython notebook that includes a very basic lesson in how to sort your way around python, aimed at law students who have never written code before.  I haven't tried this out in the classroom yet, but will do so very soon.  supcourt.json contains U.S. Supreme Court cases (plus a lot of noise) from 2011-present.

Thereafter, there'll be another notebook focused on more data stuff.


Anyone else who wants to use this stuff for similar purposes, please feel free to do so.  It's available under the Creative Commons CC BY-NC-SA license (and I consider "noncommercial" use to include any teaching of university students at any level).  Copyright 2015, Paul Gowder, http://paul-gowder.com.  I would appreciate if you let me know if this is useful to you.

That copyright claim only applies to the code and text in the ipython notebook(s) that are here/will appear here shortly. Not data file(s).  

The first associated data file is just a bunch of Supreme Court opinions.  It is derived from data made available by the Free Law Project at http://www.courtlistener.com/, so I claim no rights whatsoever to that file; neither do the folks at the Free Law Project, who have committed their database to the public domain (and anyway, it's a standard format mostly comprised of government documents; copyright claims in it would be pretty dubious in general).  There may be a second data file too soon, but that will also belong to others/nobody.
